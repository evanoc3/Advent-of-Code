# Advent of Code 


## 2022

The solutions to the 2022 problems are written in C++, and built using CMake.


## 2021

The solutions to the 2021 problems are written in Python, and use the `unittest` package for tests.

To execute the unit tests for all of the challenges, run the following commands from the top-level directory of this repository:

```
python3 -m unittest discover -s src -p "test_solution.py"
```
